Project Name: 
  Netflix Recommendations
Project Objective: 
  To provide Netflix with recommendations regarding possible options 
  for new movie acquisition and original content to be added to Netflix's streaming library.
How are you solving this problem?
  I web scraped an IMDB page, containing the top 250 movies from 2018 to April 2022, 
  scraping for data including the movie title, genre, MPA rating, and a review score.
  I then ran analysis to identify popular genres as well as a list of specific movies with above 
  average reviews in order to provide a list of possible titles or creative directions.
Job Description
  The position I chose was an associate's position within Netflix's Corporate Strategy, Planning & Analysis division.  
  In this present day, streaming services dominate the entertainment space, and at the top of these
  streaming services is Netflix. With my career focus centered on the entertainment industry,
  naturally Netflix was a company to dream to work at. The job itself involves strategic planning
  and analysis, which I would imagine translates into the titles Netflix acquires or produces
  themselves. Due to this, I felt that this is a very interesting job with many different ways of
  observing the information.  The job is involved with business recommendations regarding Netflix acquisitions and production
  investments, with analysis developed is utilized to make content planning decisions.
